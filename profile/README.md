I am a passionate software developer with extensive experience in building scalable web applications and robust APIs. Proficient in a variety of programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, and Go, I continually strive to improve my skill set.

My tech stack primarily consists of:

- **Frontend:** React, Vue.js, Angular
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Django, Flask
- **Database:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **DevOps:** Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Jenkins

Throughout my career, I have embraced Agile methodologies and practices such as TDD (Test-Driven Development) and CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment). I believe in clean, maintainable code, and have contributed to several open-source projects, allowing me to enhance my collaboration skills and learn from others in the community.

I am passionate about solving complex problems and always eager to take on new challenges. I enjoy the collaborative aspect of software development and regularly participate in code reviews and pair programming sessions to improve not just my code, but also that of my peers.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, engaging in hackathons, or contributing to online coding communities. I am particularly interested in cloud computing, machine learning, and the future of web development.
